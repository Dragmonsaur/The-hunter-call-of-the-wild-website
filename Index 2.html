<p>Some different Things in cotw</p>

<p style="color:green;">ZonesClasses: Every animal has a class that goes from 1-9 1s being duck and rabbits while 9 being stuff like yaks and tigers. Every bullet can hunt specific animals. If you kill a animal with the wrong kind of bullets then it 
reduces their trophy score (which i will explaine later) and it also effects how fast they die.</p>

<p style="color:Blue;">Zones: There are 3 different types of zones, Drink. feed and rest zones. Every animal has at least 1 of these. Drink zones are the most useful way of grinding an animal if the animal has drink zone since you can see the 
ponds and lakes they drink from on the map while rest/ feed zones can be anywhere.</p>

<p style="color:red;" >Blood splaters : There are 3 different blood splaters you can get when you shoot an aniaml, A vital organ, a Non-vital organ and a no organ hit. When you hit a animals vital organ, it will always show a lot of blood to 
indicate where you shot and that you shot a hit organ. Its also required to get a Vital organ hit to pass the harvest check.</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">Dogs: There are 3 different dogs The Bloodhound, The golden Labardor and the German Shorthair. All 3 of the dogs do something different. The Bloodhound tracks the blood of an animal until either you find the body or the 
animal stops bleeding. The Golden Labardor collects animal bodys and brings them to you, The only downside is that it only works for class 1, stuff like rabbits, ducks and pheasnts. The German Shorthair 
points to the near animal and can scare it either toward fro away from you, with the exception of predators.</p> 

<p style="color:Gold;">Great ones: Red fox, Ring neck pheasent, Red deer, Fallow deer, Whitetail Deer, Black bear, Himalayan tahr and Moose.</p>
